# Ask Yoda - Front End  
This is the front-end of the website Ask Yoda, a music recommendation website that gives you song recommendations based on two input tracks.

This project is linked to a back-end repository that you must run in parallel to the website for it to work. You can see the back-end repo by clicking <a href="https://github.com/skkuoss/AskYoda">here</a>.

### Installation
To download, visualize and edit the front-end website, you can simply clone the repository by typing:

    $ git clone https://github.com/skkuoss/AskYoda_dashboard.git

If you don't want to download the front-end into your local machine, the website is also being hosted via GitHub Pages, and you can access it through the following link: <a href="">GitHub Pages hosted webpage</a>.

Keep in mind that although you can access the hosted page, you still need to download and run the back-end repo for the page to be functional. Once again, the link for that repository, where you can also find its installation and use guides, is the following: <a href="https://github.com/skkuoss/AskYoda">Ask Yoda Back-End</a>.

### How To Use
Either if you access the webpage through GitHub Pages or through your downloaded local index.html file, you should see the following UI:

Then, the process is pretty intuitive. You type the name of a song, each one in its own input box, and then you press the button Ask Yoda to see song recommendations based on those two songs. For further precision, when you're typing the name of a song, autocomplete suggestions will pop up with song and artist names that match what you're writing.
